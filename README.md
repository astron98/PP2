### Flight Simulator

We have created a plane which can move along a defined trajectory path considering it's shadow, lighting
and rotation along the changing path's curvature. 

### Steps to start the simulator using c++ 11

1. `g++ -std=c++0x main.cpp -o flight_simulator -lglut -lGL -lGLU`
2. `./flight_simulator`
